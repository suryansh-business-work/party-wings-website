      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-4">Effective date: <strong>01 Jan 2025</strong></p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">This Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy explains how refunds and cancellations are handled for bookings and services arranged through Party Wings. Party Wings acts as a marketplace connecting Customers and Vendors. Unless otherwise stated in a Vendor's terms, the following policy applies to bookings facilitated via the Platform.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Scope</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">This policy covers cancellations by Customers and Vendors, refund eligibility, timelines and procedures for requesting refunds for services listed or booked via Party Wings in India.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Cancellation by Customer</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Customers may cancel a booking according to the cancellation terms agreed with the Vendor at the time of booking. Many Vendors have their own cancellation and refund terms which take precedence for that specific booking. In general:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>If a Vendor's cancellation policy allows refunds (full or partial), the refund amount will be calculated based on the Vendor's policy and any non-refundable deposit or fees.</li>
        <li>If no explicit Vendor policy exists, refunds will be considered according to reasonable commercial practice: early cancellations (well in advance of the event date) are more likely to receive larger refunds than last-minute cancellations.</li>
        <li>Cancellation requests should be submitted through the Party Wings chat or by contacting <a href="mailto:support@partywings.com" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">support@partywings.com</a> with booking details.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Cancellation by Vendor</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">If a Vendor cancels a confirmed booking, the Vendor should offer a full refund for any prepaid amounts (subject to any agreed exceptions). Party Wings will assist Customers in communicating with Vendors and, where appropriate, may help facilitate refunds or alternative arrangements.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Refund eligibility &amp; exceptions</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>Prepaid amounts, deposits and advance payments may be refundable in whole or part depending on the Vendor's policy and the timing of the cancellation.</li>
        <li>Certain fees may be non-refundable (for example, third-party booking fees, non-refundable deposits, or costs already incurred by the Vendor such as custom orders, perishable goods, or travel costs).</li>
        <li>Refunds will not be issued for services rendered or for portions of services performed prior to cancellation.</li>
        <li>In cases of force majeure (for example severe weather, natural disasters, government restrictions), refunds and rescheduling will be handled on a case-by-case basis in good faith between the Customer and Vendor.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. How refunds are processed</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Approved refunds are typically issued via the original payment method used for the booking. The refund processing time depends on the payment gateway or bank and may take between 7â€“14 business days after the refund is approved. Party Wings does not control the speed of third-party payment processors.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Partial refunds and adjustments</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">If a partial refund is appropriate (for example when part of an order was supplied or a portion of the service was delivered), the Vendor will calculate the refundable amount and Party Wings will assist to ensure the refund is processed. Any applicable taxes (GST) and gateway fees may affect the final refund amount.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7. Chargebacks and disputes</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">If you dispute a charge via your bank or card issuer (a chargeback), it may limit our ability to process a refund. We will cooperate with banks and payment providers during chargeback investigations. Repeated chargebacks without attempting resolution through Party Wings may lead to account restrictions.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8. Requesting a refund</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">To request a refund:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>Contact the Vendor directly through the Party Wings chat or contact support at <a href="mailto:support@partywings.com" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">support@partywings.com</a> with your booking reference, reason for cancellation and any supporting documents or photos.</li>
        <li>If you cannot reach an agreement with the Vendor, escalate the issue to Party Wings via our support email with full details. We will review the case and may request documentation from both parties.</li>
        <li>If Party Wings approves a refund, we will instruct the payment processor to issue the refund and notify you of the expected timeframe.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9. Timing and processing</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">After a refund is approved, please allow up to 14 business days for the funds to appear on your statement. Bank processing times vary by bank and payment method. Party Wings will notify you once the refund is initiated.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">10. Tax and fees</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Refunds may be adjusted to reflect taxes (e.g., GST) or non-recoverable gateway fees. If a Vendor issues a tax invoice for a refunded amount, tax treatment will follow applicable Indian tax laws and guidance.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11. Contact &amp; escalation</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">If you have questions about a refund or need help resolving a dispute, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@partywings.com" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">support@partywings.com</a>. For privacy or grievance matters contact: <a href="mailto:dpo@partywings.com" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">dpo@partywings.com</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">12. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">We may update this Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy from time to time. We will publish changes on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the Platform after changes indicates acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
