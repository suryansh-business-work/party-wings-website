      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">These Terms &amp; Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Party Wings platform ("Platform"), services and listings provided by Party Wings and its registered vendors in India. By registering, accessing or using the Platform you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Platform.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Definitions</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">"Customer" means an individual or organisation seeking event services. "Vendor" means a registered service provider on Party Wings who offers services such as catering, decoration, photography, makeup, DJ, venue, rentals and similar services. "Booking" means a confirmed service engagement between a Customer and a Vendor facilitated through Party Wings.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Eligibility</h2>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Services & Listings</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Party Wings provides a marketplace to discover and book event vendors. Listings are created by Vendors; Party Wings does not perform the services itself (unless explicitly stated). We aim to verify vendor details and portfolio where possible, but Customers should review proposals and communicate with Vendors to confirm scope, timelines and price before booking.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Booking, Payments & Fees</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">

        <li>Party Wings may charge service fees, listing fees or platform commissions; fees will be disclosed at checkout or in Vendor agreements.</li>
        <li>Customers are responsible for paying the Vendor as agreed. Vendors are responsible for invoicing and any applicable taxes (GST) as per Indian tax law.</li>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Cancellation & Refunds</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Cancellation policies vary by Vendor and service. Customers and Vendors should review the cancellation and refund terms before confirming a Booking.
