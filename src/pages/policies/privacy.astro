      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-4">Effective date: <strong>01 Jan 2025</strong></p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Party Wings ("we", "our", "us") operates the Party Wings platform and services to help customers discover and hire event vendors across India. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose and protect personal and business data in connection with our services. It is designed to be consistent with applicable Indian laws (including the Information Technology Act, 2000 and related rules) and good data protection practices.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Information we collect</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Personal information:</strong> name, email, mobile number, contact person details, profile photo or logo, identity details you choose to provide (PAN, GSTIN) and other contact details.</li>

        <li><strong>Communication data:</strong> messages, quotes and support requests exchanged with Party Wings or other users.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. How we use your information</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">We use information for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>Provide and personalize the platform and vendor matching.</li>
        <li>Process registrations, quotes, bookings and payouts to verified vendors.</li>
        <li>Verify identity and business details (including optional GSTIN / PAN checks) to improve trust on the marketplace.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you about your account, bookings, promotions and support requests.</li>
        <li>Detect and prevent fraud, abuse and to comply with legal obligations.</li>
        <li>Aggregate and analyze data to improve our services (analytics, trends).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Legal basis & consent</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Where required, we rely on your consent to collect certain information (for example marketing communications or optional verification). For core services (registration, booking, payments) we rely on contractual necessity and legitimate interests, balanced against your privacy rights. By using Party Wings and submitting information you confirm that you consent to the collection and use described in this policy.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Sharing & disclosures</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">We may share your information with:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>Other users and customers to the extent necessary to provide vendor services (for example, sharing vendor contact and portfolio details with a customer who requests a quote).</li>
        <li>Service providers and processors (payment gateways, SMS/OTP providers, hosting and cloud providers, analytics providers) under contractual safeguards.</li>
        <li>Third parties for fraud prevention, dispute resolution, and compliance with legal process such as court orders or government requests.</li>
        <li>With your explicit consent, marketing partners for promotional programs or referral payments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Storage, retention & security</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">We retain personal and business information only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined above, or as required by law (for example tax or accounting records). We implement industry-standard administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your data. However, no system is completely secure — please avoid sharing highly sensitive personal identifiers unless required for verification.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Cookies & tracking</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">We use cookies and similar technologies to provide basic functionality, store preferences and analyze usage. You can control cookie settings in your browser. Third-party analytics and advertising partners may set cookies; their privacy practices are governed by their policies.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7. Vendor verification & optional identity checks</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">To increase trust, we may request optional documents (GSTIN, PAN, business registration) or conduct checks. Uploading GSTIN or PAN is voluntary. Any verification performed will be done securely and the results stored to support payouts and credibility on the platform.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8. Payments & payout information</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">If you provide UPI ID or bank account details to receive payouts, we use a payment processor to facilitate transfers. We do not store full card details (if you use a payment gateway, that gateway will handle card storage under its own policy). Payouts may require identity verification and tax-related information as per Indian law.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9. Your rights and choices</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Depending on applicable law, you may have rights to access, rectify, restrict processing, portability, or erase your personal data.

We will respond to verified requests as required by law.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700">Our service may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites. Please review their privacy policies before sharing data.</p>
